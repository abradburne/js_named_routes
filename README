Named Routes in Javascript
==========================

This uncreatively named plugin installs a controller and view which creates a methods for generating named routes
in javascript.

== USAGE

This plugin injects a route automatically for your JS named routes controller.

Install, visit the following URL:

http://myapp.com/javascripts/named_routes.js

Use the above URL in a script tag in your app or use the asset helper like so:

<%= javascript_include_tag :named_routes %>

This plugin uses page caching, but lacks any intelligence for sweeping the cached file if you've made changes to
your routes. That shouldn't be a problem if you are using Capistrano for production deployments because the cache
is normally stored in "RAILS_ROOT/public" which is not kept across deployments. Caching is disabled in
development, but if you turn on caching you may need to clear the cached file:

cd RAILS_ROOT
rm public/javascripts/named_routes.js

In your javascript, you can do:

some_named_route({id: 5, name: 'joshua'})
